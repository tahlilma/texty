# texty
A broken and very buggy Discord bot which is capable to detecting text from images.

## Setup
Setup is fairly easy. You just need to head over to the Discord Developer Console from which you will need to create an app and add a bot to it. After doing that you will get a api token which you can copy and put it in  a ```.env``` file in the root of the project.
The ```.env``` file should contain this
```
TOKEN=YOUROKENHERE
PREFIX=YOURPREFIXHERE
```
